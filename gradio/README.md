# Random Forest Prediction App

This is a simple machine learning application built using **Gradio** that combines a **Random Forest** model with an interactive web interface to predict a class based on two input features. The features are provided through sliders, and the model predicts the class, displaying the result in real-time.

The application merges **Machine Learning** and **Dash** to create an interactive interface for model prediction. This integration allows you to build an interactive, user-friendly interface that makes it easier for users to input data, view results, and understand the model's output without needing to run complex code themselves.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to integrate a **machine learning model** (in this case, a Random Forest classifier) with a **web interface** (using Gradio) for easy interaction. This approach can be extended to more complex models, enabling users to interact with machine learning models in a visually appealing and accessible way. By combining **ML** and **Dash**, you can:
- Easily deploy ML models with an intuitive web interface.
- Allow non-technical users to interact with machine learning models without writing code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Gradio
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (or download the code).
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install gradio scikit-learn pandas
